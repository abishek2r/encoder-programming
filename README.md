# encoder-programming
Most of the mobile robots won't go straight because of some errors in velocities between the actuators which make the robot move.
Here I have used encoders to know the position of the actuators at any point of time where I can determine the velocity and correct the other acutator's veloctiy I also 
took care of errors which might happen due to some external factors such as more friction in one side of the robot.
I have used controllers similar to PID to rectify the issue.
